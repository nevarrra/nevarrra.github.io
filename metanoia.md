*There once was an ordinary family with loving parents and a child. They lived happily, and the bond between the child and his mother has always been especially strong. Until one day, the mother has disappeared. The father would tell the child a fairy tale, where the mother has become a princess and went to rule over a magical castle, living happily ever after. The child, fascinated by the story, would ask his father to retell it again and again in slightest details every night. One night, the child, missing his mother so much, has decided to go and visit her in the castle. He grabbed his plushy and a backpack and headed outside. Navigating with the details from the fairy tale, he followed his motherâ€™s favourite flowers and finally arrived at the  castle...*

Metanoia is a vertical slice of a short, horror game that evolves around the story of a child who needs to solve the riddles of the magical castle in order to find his mother.

### **My Input**

My work in this project was tightly connected to: 
+ Custom car mechanics
*I have developed an arcade-like car mechanics for the player's car, that involved physics manipulation for features such as suspension, torque and car's gravity.*
+ Music synchronization & generation of the collectable beats
*With the use of UE4's Synesthesia plugin to extract music's offset and corresponding timestamps, I have implemented a logic for the generation of the beats for every player in a runtime, with relation to their current position, direction, time left until the rhythmic event, and velocity to ensure that the players collect the beat at the right moment. I have also implemented a system to read several stems of the audio file and generate the beat collectibles based on which instrument in the song is most prominent.*
+ Server-side programming & Matchmaking
*I have been working with the replication of the sounds as well as the dedicated server setup and messages exchange. I have also fully developed the external Matchmaking server in .NET 5.*

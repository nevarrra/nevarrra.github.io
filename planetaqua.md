## Planet Aqua

Solo project of an Android application made for Hackathon event held during my 2nd year at IADE - Creative University.

### **About the project** 

#### **Specifications**

+ **Target Platform:** Android OS;
+ **Engine/Tools:** Android Studio, Kotlin;
+ **Development Time (approx.)** 2 days.

Following the theme requirements for this Hackathon event, this project's purpose is to raise awareness of the amounts of water consumed daily by a single person.
Planet Aqua is a simple Android application that allows one to track how much water is being spent for daily tasks, such as running a washing machine, showering, using the bathroom, and alike. The background of the interface of the application represents a water pool that drains once consumption has been registered. Once empty, it will indicate that the user has run out, or is exceeding the amount of water one should consume a day to prevent global water shortages. There are several buttons per each appliance/action that would consume water, pressing which the users will register their consumption. The application has been made shortly before the Interational Water Day and is suggested to be used at least once a year on this day to raise people's awareness of how much water is being (over)spent by an average person daily.

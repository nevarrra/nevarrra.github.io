*In the desert known as Singing Sands the lands have been corrupted by the God of Chaos. The sacred sands of the desert now imbued with the corruption of the God formed artifacts that started being highly sought by all creatures of the world. Motivated by greed and power the chaotic spirits started trying to accumulate as much
of the artifacts as possible creating an imbalance in the area and threatening nearby settlements. In order to fix the chaos, the guardians of the desert, the good spirits of the warriors once roamed this region, were forced to take action. They started fighting the bad creatures in order to use or destroy the artifacts. The two sons of the Gods on each side - Akil and Kek - meet on the battlefield to decide the outcome of this war.*  

Singing Sands is a 2D fighting local multiplayer prototype game for Windows, featuring a Companion App made for Android OS. Two characters are available for the players to pick, each with their unique special abilities. The main game consists of the battle arena where the players combat each other.  
In the companion app, however, they are able to create their own items (runes), by drawing their visual representation and setting up their attributes. The balancing works by reducing other attributes, so that, for example, when players decide to max up the attack speed provided by the rune, they will lose a significant amount of attack damage. The companion app is synchronized with the game, and once a rune is equipped, the changes will be displayed in the main game.

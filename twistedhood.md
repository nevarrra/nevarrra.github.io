*The game setting takes place in the universe of “Little Red Riding Hood”. 
The Little Red was bitten by the Big Bad Wolf on her way to the Grandma’s house and became a werewolf, the strongest in the forest wolves, and quickly took the place of their alpha.  
While still being half-person, she continued visiting her grandmother and bringing her usual goodies, but in time the beast nature overtook her human side and the Little Red started to spend more and more time with the wolves. By the time the starving Grandma discovered her granddaughter’s sketchy business, the Little Red had already formed a solid pack of wolves and changed her name to Little Howling Hood.  
Indignant, the old woman gathered local hunters to eliminate those wolves and capture the Little Red to cure her from the curse and restore the supply of goodies once again.*  

Twisted Hood is, thematically, a continuation of my first game - Little Howling Hood.   
It is a 2D Auto-Chess vertical slice, made for a web browser. Originally, a turn-based game, it can also be played real-time provided that both of the players are online. The players are required to create an account in order to be able to start the game. Among the persistent data, there are: account information, battle history, faction, and the ongoing battles' states.  
Upon the creation of an account, the players have to choose their faction - Werewolves or Hunters. This choice is irreversible and will decide the camp's visuals as well as what kind of units the player will be able to buy during combats. Each faction has its own unique units with different attributes, and a main character with a unique ability. For the Werewolves it is the Little Howling Hood, and for the Hunters it is the Grandma. Following the traditional way of playing an Auto-Chess game, both of the players will start on equal terms and upgrade their army and level during the battle.  
The player can start a battle by opening a list of attackable players (i.e. players who do not have more than 5 ongoing battles and are of the opposing faction) and initiate the battle by placing his units on the grid. Once the opponent comes online, he will be notified of a new ongoing battle and will have certain amount of days to respond by placing his own units on his side of the grid. Once the combat has happened, the players who are online at the moment will be able to watch it live, otherwise - they will receive another notification about the combat outcome. The battle will then continue for 2 to 3 rounds, deciding the winner by the amount of the combats won.  
Another key feature of the game is the battle replay. The players are able to rewatch their past battles in details by going to the battle history in their camp. This will replay every round as it happened with additional information about each unit's health and other attributes.  
Due to the time constraints, the visuals of the vertical slice were not fully polished, however, technically, all of the features are fully functional.

### **My Input**

I have worked on this project alone, and every phase of the development was tackled by myself.
